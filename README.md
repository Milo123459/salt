# salt

### Fast, simple task management from the CLI

## Install

scoop install salt
```

MacOS: [Brew](https://brew.sh)

brew install salt

## Concepts

You have a node, and a task.

Think of it like a tree with apples. The tree is the node, the apples are the tasks. They just live under specific houses.

## How to use

Pretty simple:

Run `salt action` to see all commands.

Or, run `salt node action` to see all node sub-commands.
